Software Development Process Using LLM

This document outlines a cyclical process for software development that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a small working artifact. The process emphasizes the importance of documentation, testing, and version control at each stage, ensuring a clear understanding of the projectâ€™s evolution and facilitating collaboration.

Process Overview

Initial Meta Document Creation

Collaborate with the LLM to develop a meta document that outlines the purpose and general view of the project.

This document serves as a foundation for understanding the project's goals and scope.

Coding Phase

Request the LLM to start coding based on the meta document.

Develop the code iteratively until it becomes complex and hard to understand.

Testing Phase

Ask the LLM to create unit and integration tests that validate the current functionality of the code.

Ensure that tests are comprehensive and cover various scenarios.

Documentation Update

At each step, update the meta documentation to reflect:

The current state of the project.

Any problems encountered.

The desired future state of the project.

Test-Driven Development Cycle

Instruct the LLM to write a failing test for the next development step.

Document this test and its purpose.

Request the LLM to modify the code to ensure that the test passes.

Update the documentation to include changes made and the rationale behind them.

Iteration

Continue this cycle of developing, testing, documenting, and refining until satisfied with the outcome.

Emphasize the use of version control throughout the process to track changes and facilitate collaboration.

Automation of Tests

Ensure that all tests run automatically at each stage of development to maintain code quality and reliability.
