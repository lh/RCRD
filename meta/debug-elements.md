# Debug Elements to Remove Before Deployment

## Current Selection Display
Located in RetinalCalculator component, this debugging feature shows:
- "Current Selection:" heading
- Break count ("No breaks marked")
- Detachment segment count ("Detachment segments: X")

### Purpose During Development
1. Visual verification of segment selection state
2. Quick feedback for testing clock face interactions
3. Helps debug synchronization between left and right panels

### Location
- Appears in both left and right panels in desktop view
- Appears in mobile view below the clock face
- Rendered within a `.bg-gray-50` container

### Removal Notes
1. Remove the entire Current Selection section from:
   - Left panel container
   - Right panel container
   - Mobile view container
2. Tests have been updated to not rely on these debug elements
   - Removed from RetinalCalculator.desktop.test.jsx
   - Any new tests should not depend on these elements

## Other Debug Elements

### Touch Debug Panel
- ID: 'touch-debug'
- Class: 'text-xs font-mono bg-gray-100'
- Purpose: Shows touch event information during development
- Remove before deployment

### Debug Indicator
- Small red square in bottom-right corner
- Style: `width: 20px; height: 20px; background-color: red;`
- Purpose: Visual indicator for development mode
- Remove before deployment

## Impact of Removal
- No functional impact on the application
- Tests will continue to pass (debug elements not included in test assertions)
- UI will be cleaner and more focused on essential elements

## Verification After Removal
1. Check that all core functionality works:
   - Segment selection
   - Form input synchronization
   - Risk calculation
2. Verify tests still pass
3. Confirm layout remains stable without debug elements

## Note
These elements were intentionally excluded from test coverage as they are temporary development aids. The application's core functionality is tested independently of these debug features.
