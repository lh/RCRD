# useClockInteractions Test Improvements

## Current Test Status

All tests are now passing and providing comprehensive coverage of the hook's functionality:

### Core State Tests
✓ returns initial state values
- Verifies all expected functions and state values are present
- Confirms default state values are correct

### Touch Device Detection
✓ detects touch device via ontouchstart
✓ detects touch device via maxTouchPoints
- Tests both methods of touch device detection
- Properly mocks window and navigator properties
- Verifies correct state updates

### Segment Interaction Tests
✓ handles segment interaction in add mode
✓ handles segment interaction in remove mode
- Tests both adding and removing segments
- Verifies correct state updates
- Confirms onChange callback behavior
- Validates segmentToHour conversion

### Drawing State Tests
✓ handles drawing state
- Tests drawing initialization
- Verifies event prevention
- Confirms state updates

### Clear Functionality
✓ handles clear all
- Tests complete state reset
- Verifies both segments and tears are cleared
- Confirms onChange callback with empty state

### Tear Click Behavior
✓ handles tear click in non-touch mode
- Tests tear selection toggle
- Verifies event propagation handling
- Confirms state updates and callbacks
- Tests both adding and removing tears

## Implementation Details

### Mock Setup
```javascript
jest.mock('../../utils/clockCalculations', () => ({
  segmentToHour: (segment) => {
    const num = parseInt(segment.replace('segment', ''), 10);
    return isNaN(num) ? 0 : num;
  }
}));
```

### Touch Device Management
```javascript
beforeEach(() => {
  delete window.ontouchstart;
  Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'maxTouchPoints', { value: 0 });
});
```

### Timer Management
```javascript
beforeEach(() => {
  jest.useFakeTimers();
});

afterEach(() => {
  jest.useRealTimers();
});
```

## Test Organization

Tests are organized by functionality:
1. Basic state initialization
2. Device detection
3. Core interactions (segments)
4. Drawing functionality
5. State management (clear)
6. Event handling (tear clicks)

## Best Practices Applied

1. Proper Mock Setup
   - Mocks are defined at module level
   - Implementation matches expected behavior
   - Cleanup in afterEach

2. State Management
   - All state changes wrapped in act()
   - Timer management for async operations
   - Proper cleanup between tests

3. Event Handling
   - Event mocks include required methods
   - Event propagation verified
   - Touch state properly controlled

4. Assertions
   - State changes verified
   - Callback behaviors confirmed
   - Event handling validated

## Future Improvements

While all tests are now passing, potential future improvements could include:

1. Additional Edge Cases
   - Multiple rapid interactions
   - Boundary conditions for segments
   - Error state handling

2. Performance Testing
   - Large number of segments
   - Rapid state changes
   - Memory usage patterns

3. Integration Scenarios
   - Interaction with parent components
   - Complex user interaction patterns
   - State persistence scenarios

## Notes

- All tests now pass without skips
- Full coverage of core functionality
- Proper isolation of touch device state
- Comprehensive event handling verification
- Clear documentation of test purposes
