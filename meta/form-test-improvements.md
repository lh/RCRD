# RetinalCalculator Form Test Improvements

## Key Changes

1. Fixed RiskResults Mock:
   - Updated to use fullModelRisk/significantModelRisk props
   - Added proper model selection logic
   - Added proper styling classes for consistent layout
   - Fixed probability display format

2. Fixed Test Data:
   - Changed probability and logit to numbers (25.5, -1.082)
   - Added missing fields (cryotherapy, tamponade)
   - Added model type to calculation expectations

3. Fixed Test Structure:
   - Removed invalid "current selection" text check
   - Updated reset test to expect default age '50'
   - Added proper async/await handling
   - Improved error handling with waitFor

## Test Coverage

1. Form Calculation:
   - Tests complete calculation workflow
   - Verifies all input fields
   - Checks proper model type
   - Validates calculation parameters

2. Form Validation:
   - Tests disabled state handling
   - Verifies validation messages
   - Checks proper button state

3. Reset Functionality:
   - Tests complete reset workflow
   - Verifies default values
   - Checks component cleanup

4. Read-only Mode:
   - Tests clock face in results view
   - Verifies disabled state of controls
   - Checks proper display

## Mock Improvements

1. ClockFace Mock:
   - Added proper class handling
   - Improved button structure
   - Added touch device support

2. RiskInputForm Mock:
   - Added all required fields
   - Improved event handling
   - Added proper positioning support

## Best Practices Applied

1. Async Testing:
   - Used waitFor for async operations
   - Added proper error handling
   - Improved test stability

2. Component Structure:
   - Matched actual component hierarchy
   - Maintained proper prop types
   - Followed React best practices

3. Test Organization:
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Logical test flow
   - Proper setup and cleanup
