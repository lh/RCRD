# MobileRetinalCalculator Test Improvements

## Changes Made

1. Fixed Touch Device Detection Test:
   - Added missing touch indicator element to ClockFace mock
   - Added proper styling to match component behavior
   - Test now properly verifies touch device state changes

2. Fixed Results Display Test:
   - Updated text expectation from "estimated risk of failure" to "probability of requiring additional surgery"
   - Split probability check into separate text content checks
   - Improved test readability with better section comments

3. Fixed Reset Functionality Test:
   - Updated expectation to check for default age '50' instead of empty string
   - Matches actual component behavior where age resets to default value

4. Added Comprehensive Validation Test:
   - Tests all validation states in sequence:
     1. Initial state (age defaults to '50'): "Detachment area required"
     2. After clearing age: "Age and detachment area required"
     3. With detachment but no age: "Age required"
     4. With age but no detachment: "Detachment area required"
     5. With both filled: Calculate button enabled

## Mock Improvements

1. ClockFace Mock:
   - Added proper touch device indicator structure
   - Improved readability with comments
   - Matches actual component behavior

2. Risk Calculation Mock:
   - Changed probability and logit to numbers instead of strings
   - Matches actual calculation return types

## Test Organization

Tests now follow a logical flow:
1. Device interaction tests
2. Form interaction tests
3. Results display tests
4. Validation message tests

Each test is focused on a specific aspect of functionality while maintaining independence from other tests.
