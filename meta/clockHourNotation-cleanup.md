# ClockHourNotation Cleanup

## Changes Made

1. Removed misleading static constants:
   - Removed `SEGMENTS_PER_HOUR = 2`
   - Removed `TOTAL_SEGMENTS = 24`
   - These constants weren't used and incorrectly suggested a 24-segment system

2. Updated implementation comments to reflect actual 60-segment system:
   - Updated hourRanges object to show 5 segments per hour
   - Updated special case handling for hour 12 (segments 55-59 and 0-4)
   - Updated total detachment threshold to 55 segments
   - Updated special handling for hours 3 and 9 to use correct ranges

3. Updated test documentation:
   - Removed references to 24-segment system
   - Clearly documented the 60-segment system used by the UI
   - Added segment ranges for each hour
   - Added special cases documentation

## System Overview

The application uses a 60-segment system (5 segments per hour) for the clock face:
- Each hour has 5 segments (e.g., Hour 1: 0-4, Hour 2: 5-9, etc.)
- Hour 12 handles wraparound (segments 55-59 and 0-4)
- Special cases for hours 3, 6, and 9 are handled in the implementation

## Test Status

All tests are now passing and correctly reflect the actual behavior of the system. The tests verify:
- Segment to hour mapping
- Hour range building
- Special case handling
- Total detachment detection
- Midnight crossing cases
