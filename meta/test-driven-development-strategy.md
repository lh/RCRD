# Test-Driven Development Strategy

## Overview
We will adopt an iterative, test-driven development approach focusing on small, manageable changes. Each change will follow this cycle:

1. Identify a single, specific issue
2. Write/update the test
3. Verify the test fails (red)
4. Make the minimal code change
5. Verify the test passes (green)
6. Refactor if needed
7. Get feedback and approval before moving to next issue

## Current Priority: RiskInputForm Accessibility

### Starting Point: Age Input Accessibility
The simplest issue to start with is adding proper label association to the age input:

1. Current Test Status:
```javascript
test.skip('renders age input with validation')
```

2. Proposed First Change:
- Add id/htmlFor association between label and input
- This is the simplest change that provides immediate accessibility benefit

3. Test Modification Steps:
a. Remove .skip
b. Update test to check for:
   - label has htmlFor="age-input"
   - input has id="age-input"

4. Code Change Steps:
a. Add id to input
b. Add htmlFor to label

### Subsequent Changes (In Order of Complexity)

1. Basic ARIA Attributes
   - Add role="spinbutton"
   - Add aria-required="true"
   - Add aria-label

2. Age Range Validation
   - Update min/max values
   - Add validation messages
   - Add aria-invalid state

3. Error Message Display
   - Add specific error messages
   - Update validation logic
   - Add error state styling

## Questions for Discussion

1. Do you agree with starting with the label association as our first change?
2. Should we handle the age validation range change at the same time as the label association, or keep them separate?
3. Would you like to see the specific test changes before we proceed?

## Next Steps

1. Await your feedback on this strategy
2. Make the first test change based on your guidance
3. Show you the proposed code changes
4. Iterate based on your feedback
