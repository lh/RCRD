# MinimalClockSelector Analysis

## Overview

The MinimalClockSelector component and its tests represent a prototype/experimental version of the clock selection functionality. This component was used to develop and test core clock selection behavior in isolation before implementing it in the full RetinalCalculator.

## Location

Located in the `scratch/` directory, which indicates:
- Experimental/prototype code
- Not part of the main application
- Used for development and testing purposes

## Test Suite Status

The test suite is intentionally skipped because:
1. It's a prototype version
2. The functionality has been moved to the main codebase
3. The behavior is now tested in the main test suites:
   - RetinalCalculator.test.jsx
   - RetinalCalculator.interactions.test.jsx
   - Other related test files

## Component Features

The minimal version includes:
1. Basic clock face interactions:
   - Tear toggle
   - Segment toggle
   - Hover handling
2. Simple controls:
   - Clear all functionality
   - Touch device detection
3. Parent communication:
   - onChange callback
   - State management

## Test Coverage

The test suite verifies:
1. Basic rendering
2. Touch device detection
3. Core interactions:
   - Tear toggling
   - Segment toggling
   - Clear all functionality
4. State management:
   - Selection persistence
   - Parent notifications
5. Responsive layout:
   - Viewport-based classes
   - Control positioning

## Value as Reference

While skipped in the main test runs, this test suite serves as:
1. Documentation of core requirements
2. Example of component isolation
3. Reference for basic interaction patterns
4. Guide for test organization

## Migration Status

The functionality has been:
- [x] Prototyped in MinimalClockSelector
- [x] Tested in isolation
- [x] Migrated to main codebase
- [x] Integrated with full RetinalCalculator
- [x] Covered by main test suites

## Future Considerations

1. Code cleanup:
   - Consider removing scratch directory
   - Archive prototype code if needed
   - Document migration in commit history

2. Test improvements:
   - Port any unique test cases to main suites
   - Ensure full coverage in main implementation
   - Document test patterns for reuse
