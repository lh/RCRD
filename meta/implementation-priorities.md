# Implementation Priorities

[Previous content remains the same until "Testing Approach" section]

### Testing Approach
- Follow test-driven development cycle:
  1. Write/update test for specific change
  2. Verify test fails
  3. Make code changes
  4. Verify test passes
  5. Refactor if needed
- Make small, focused changes
- Get feedback after each change
- Maintain high test coverage
