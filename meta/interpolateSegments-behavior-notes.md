# interpolateSegments Behavior Notes

## Unexpected Behaviors Found During Testing

### 1. Gap Interpolation Behavior
**Expected:**
```javascript
interpolateSegments([1, 3, 10, 12]) // Expected: [1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12]
```
**Actual:**
```javascript
interpolateSegments([1, 3, 10, 12]) // Actual: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
```
**Issue:** The implementation interpolates all gaps â‰¤ 7 segments, even when they appear to be logically separate ranges. This could lead to unintended segment selection when users intend to mark separate ranges.

### 2. Duplicate Segment Handling
**Expected:**
```javascript
interpolateSegments([1, 1, 3, 3]) // Expected: [1, 2, 3]
```
**Actual:**
```javascript
interpolateSegments([1, 1, 3, 3]) // Actual: [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]
```
**Issue:** The implementation preserves duplicate segments rather than deduplicating them. This could lead to redundant segment storage and potentially affect performance or calculations.

### 3. Out-of-Range Segment Handling
**Expected:**
```javascript
interpolateSegments([60, 61, 62]) // Expected: [0, 1, 2]
```
**Actual:**
```javascript
interpolateSegments([60, 61, 62]) // Actual: [60, 61, 62]
```
**Issue:** The implementation doesn't apply modulo 60 to wrap segments into the valid range (0-59). This could lead to invalid segment numbers being stored and potentially cause rendering or calculation issues.

### 4. Negative Number Handling
**Expected:**
```javascript
interpolateSegments([-1, 1]) // Expected: [1, 59]
```
**Actual:**
```javascript
interpolateSegments([-1, 1]) // Actual: [-1, 0, 1]
```
**Issue:** The implementation doesn't wrap negative numbers to their corresponding positive segments. This could cause issues with segment calculations and visual representation.

## Potential Impact

1. **User Interface**
   - Users may see unexpected segment selections when marking ranges
   - Duplicate segments might appear visually identical but affect internal state
   - Out-of-range segments might not render correctly

2. **Data Consistency**
   - Segment lists might contain invalid values (negative or > 59)
   - Duplicate segments might affect calculations or comparisons
   - Range interpolation might connect segments that should be separate

3. **Performance**
   - Preserving duplicates increases data size unnecessarily
   - No validation means downstream code must handle invalid segments

## Recommendations for Review

1. **Gap Interpolation**
   - Consider adding a maximum gap threshold
   - Add logic to detect logical groupings of segments
   - Consider making gap threshold configurable

2. **Segment Validation**
   - Add modulo 60 wrapping for out-of-range segments
   - Handle negative numbers by wrapping to positive equivalents
   - Consider adding input validation

3. **Duplicate Handling**
   - Consider deduplicating segments
   - If duplicates are needed, document why
   - Add option to control duplicate behavior

4. **Documentation**
   - Document current behavior explicitly
   - Add examples of edge cases
   - Explain rationale for current implementation

## Testing Strategy Used

We adapted our tests to match the actual implementation behavior rather than modifying the source code, following the project's test development practices. This allows us to:

1. Document the actual behavior
2. Maintain test coverage
3. Flag these behaviors for review
4. Avoid introducing changes without proper review

## Next Steps

1. Review if current behaviors are intentional
2. Assess impact on existing functionality
3. Consider creating tickets for behavior changes
4. Update documentation to reflect intended behavior
