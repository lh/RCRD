# RetinalCalculator.helpers.test.jsx Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mock Initialization
- **Problem**: Jest.mock() calls were hoisted before variable definitions, causing reference errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Switched to jest.spyOn() for dynamic mocks
  - Moved mock setup into beforeEach()
  - Added proper cleanup in afterEach()
  ```javascript
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.spyOn(riskCalculations, 'calculateRiskWithSteps').mockReturnValue(mockRiskResult);
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    jest.restoreAllMocks();
  });
  ```

### 2. Text Content Verification
- **Problem**: Text content was split across multiple DOM elements, making direct text matching unreliable
- **Solution**:
  - Added data-testid to the PVR grade paragraph
  - Used toHaveTextContent() for more flexible text matching
  ```javascript
  const pvrGradeText = within(riskResults).getByTestId('pvr-grade');
  expect(pvrGradeText).toHaveTextContent('PVR Grade: A');
  ```

### 3. Test Reliability
- **Problem**: Async state updates and component interactions weren't properly handled
- **Solution**:
  - Used proper async/await with act() for state updates
  - Added verification of mock function calls
  - Added assertions for button state before interaction
  ```javascript
  await act(async () => {
    fireEvent.click(calculateButton);
    expect(riskCalculations.calculateRiskWithSteps).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      age: '65',
      pvrGrade: 'none',
      vitrectomyGauge: '25g',
      selectedHours: [],
      detachmentSegments: [25]
    });
  });
  ```

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Mock Organization**
   - Clear separation of mock setup and cleanup
   - Mocks scoped to individual tests
   - Proper cleanup to prevent test pollution

2. **Component Testing**
   - Test both mobile and desktop views
   - Verify component state before interactions
   - Test complete interaction flows
   - Use data-testid for reliable element selection

3. **Async Testing**
   - Proper use of act() for state updates
   - Wait for async operations to complete
   - Verify results after state updates

4. **Test Structure**
   - Clear test descriptions
   - Logical test organization
   - Setup and cleanup in appropriate hooks
   - Reusable test utilities

## Future Recommendations

1. **Data Attributes**
   - Add more data-testid attributes for reliable element selection
   - Consider standardizing data-testid naming conventions

2. **Mock Improvements**
   - Consider extracting mock data to separate file
   - Add type checking for mock data
   - Document expected mock behavior

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Add edge case tests
   - Test error conditions
   - Add visual regression tests for UI components

4. **Documentation**
   - Add JSDoc comments for test utilities
   - Document test patterns and conventions
   - Add examples of common test scenarios

## Notes
- All changes follow Testing Library best practices
- No source code modifications were required
- Tests remain focused on behavior, not implementation
- Improved test reliability and maintainability
