# RetinalCalculator Test Improvements

## Results Display Tests

### Fixed Issues
1. Mock Implementation
   - Removed extra properties from calculateRiskWithSteps mock that were causing React rendering issues
   - Mock now only returns properties expected by RiskResults component:
     * probability
     * steps
     * logit
     * age
     * pvrGrade
     * vitrectomyGauge

2. Test Structure
   - Added proper cleanup after each test
   - Improved timeout handling for async operations
   - Added explicit waiting for UI elements

### Test Coverage
The tests now properly verify:
1. Math details visibility toggling
2. Complete input summary display
3. Value persistence through reset and recalculate cycle

### Best Practices Applied
1. Mock Isolation
   - Mocks only return data needed by the component
   - Mock implementations are reset between tests
   - Different mock responses for different test scenarios

2. Async Testing
   - Proper use of waitFor for async operations
   - Reasonable timeout values (2000ms)
   - Clear error messages for timeouts

3. Component Testing
   - Tests focus on component behavior
   - Verifies both initial render and post-interaction states
   - Checks proper cleanup after reset
