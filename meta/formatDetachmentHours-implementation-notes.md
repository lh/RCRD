# formatDetachmentHours Implementation Notes

## Changes Made

### 1. Segment-to-Hour Mapping
Fixed how segments map to clock hours:
- Segments 0-4 → hours 12 and 1 (midnight crossing)
- Segments 5-9 → hours 1 and 2 (boundary overlap)
- Segments 50-54 → hours 10 and 11 (pre-midnight)
- Segments 55-59 → hours 11 and 12 (midnight approach)

### 2. Range Merging Logic
Improved how ranges are merged, especially around midnight:
- Adjacent ranges (e.g., 3-4 and 4-5) are merged into single ranges (3-5)
- Ranges crossing midnight (e.g., 11-12 and 1-2) are merged properly (11-2)
- Multiple ranges remain separate when appropriate (e.g., "1-3; 6-8")

### 3. Special Cases Handling
Added proper handling for special cases:
- Single hour displays as "4 o'clock"
- Continuous ranges display as "4-8 o'clock"
- Separate ranges display as "1-3; 6-8 o'clock"
- Midnight crossing ranges display as "10-2 o'clock"
- Total detachment displays as "1-12 o'clock (Total)"

## Test Coverage

### Basic Cases
- Empty input → "None"
- Single hour → "4 o'clock"
- Continuous range → "4-8 o'clock"
- Separate ranges → "1-3; 6-8 o'clock"

### Edge Cases
- Midnight crossing → "10-2 o'clock"
- Hour boundaries → "4-5 o'clock"
- Total detachment → "1-12 o'clock (Total)"

### Direction Cases
- Clockwise selection → Same output regardless of direction
- Counterclockwise selection → Same output regardless of direction

## Implementation Details

### Hour Mapping Logic
```javascript
// Special case for segments 0-4 (maps to both 12 and 1)
if (normalizedSegment <= 4) {
    hours.add(12);
    hours.add(1);
    return;
}

// Special case for segments 55-59 (maps to 12 and 11)
if (normalizedSegment >= 55) {
    hours.add(12);
    hours.add(11);
    return;
}
```

### Range Merging Logic
```javascript
// Check if we have a range that crosses midnight
const hasMidnightCrossing = ranges.some(r => r.end === 12) && ranges.some(r => r.start === 1);
if (hasMidnightCrossing) {
    const preRange = ranges.find(r => r.end === 12);
    const postRange = ranges.find(r => r.start === 1);
    
    if (preRange && postRange) {
        const mergedRange = {
            start: preRange.start,
            end: postRange.end
        };
        // Filter out original ranges and add merged one
        const otherRanges = ranges.filter(r => r !== preRange && r !== postRange);
        ranges.length = 0;
        ranges.push(...otherRanges, mergedRange);
    }
}
```

## Verification

All test cases now pass:
- ✓ handles empty input
- ✓ formats single hour correctly
- ✓ formats continuous range correctly
- ✓ formats separate ranges correctly
- ✓ formats midnight crossing range correctly
- ✓ formats total detachment correctly
- ✓ formats clockwise selection correctly
- ✓ formats counterclockwise selection correctly
- ✓ handles hour boundary segments correctly

## Next Steps

The next critical issue to address is that the risk calculation is failing because the clock hours of detachment are not being passed to the risk calculation properly. This needs to be investigated and fixed to ensure accurate risk assessments.
