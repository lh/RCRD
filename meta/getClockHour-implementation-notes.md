# getClockHour Implementation Notes

## Core Functionality

The getClockHour function converts a segment number (0-59) to its corresponding clock hour (1-12) with several special cases and rules.

### Special Cases

1. Hour 12 Segments
   ```javascript
   if (segment >= 57 || segment <= 2) return 12;
   ```
   - Segments 57-59 (before midnight)
   - Segments 0-2 (after midnight)
   - Creates a 6-segment range for hour 12

2. Hour 6 Segments
   ```javascript
   if (segment >= 28 && segment <= 32) return 6;
   ```
   - Special wider range for hour 6
   - Covers 5 segments (28-32)
   - Centered around segment 30

### Hour Calculation Rules

1. Near Hour Boundaries
   ```javascript
   if (segment % 5 <= 2) {
       return Math.floor(segment / 5);
   }
   ```
   - For segments within 2 of a multiple of 5
   - Uses floor division to get hour
   - Example: segment 7 → hour 1 (7 % 5 = 2)

2. Regular Segments
   ```javascript
   const hourNumber = Math.floor(segment / 5) + 1;
   ```
   - For segments more than 2 from multiple of 5
   - Rounds up to next hour
   - Example: segment 8 → hour 2

3. Hour Bounds
   ```javascript
   return Math.min(Math.max(hourNumber, 1), 11);
   ```
   - Ensures regular hours stay between 1 and 11
   - Hour 12 handled by special case only

## Segment to Hour Mapping

### Regular Hours
- Hour 1: segments 3-7
- Hour 2: segments 8-12
- Hour 3: segments 13-17
- Hour 4: segments 18-22
- Hour 5: segments 23-27
- Hour 6: segments 28-32 (special case)
- Hour 7: segments 33-37
- Hour 8: segments 38-42
- Hour 9: segments 43-47
- Hour 10: segments 48-52
- Hour 11: segments 53-56

### Special Hours
- Hour 12: segments 57-59, 0-2
- Hour 6: segments 28-32 (wider range)

## Out-of-Bounds Behavior

1. Negative Segments
   - Treated as hour 12 due to modulo arithmetic
   - Example: -5 → hour 12

2. Segments > 59
   - Also treated as hour 12
   - Example: 65 → hour 12

This behavior might be unexpected but is consistent with:
- The special handling of hour 12
- The modular nature of clock arithmetic

## Implementation Considerations

1. Hour 12 Special Case
   - Handled first in the code
   - Takes precedence over other rules
   - Creates wraparound at midnight

2. Hour 6 Special Case
   - Wider range than other hours
   - May be related to medical significance
   - Centered on segment 30

3. Boundary Handling
   - Uses modulo for near-boundary decisions
   - Different rules for segments near vs far from boundaries
   - Ensures smooth transitions between hours

## Test Coverage

1. Special Cases
   - Hour 12 wraparound
   - Hour 6 extended range
   - Boundary segments

2. Regular Hours
   - All standard hour conversions
   - Boundary conditions
   - Edge cases

3. Out-of-Bounds
   - Negative segments → hour 12
   - Large segments → hour 12
   - Preserves clock face wraparound

## Usage Notes

1. Input Validation
   - Function assumes numeric input
   - No explicit error handling for non-numeric values
   - Relies on JavaScript type coercion

2. Hour Range
   - Regular hours: 1-11
   - Special hour: 12
   - No validation for medical validity

3. Performance
   - Constant time complexity O(1)
   - No loops or complex calculations
   - Efficient for repeated calls

## Future Considerations

1. Input Validation
   - Could add explicit type checking
   - Could handle NaN and undefined
   - Could validate numeric range

2. Error Handling
   - Could throw errors for invalid input
   - Could return null for out-of-bounds
   - Could add warning for unexpected values

3. Documentation
   - Could add more JSDoc comments
   - Could explain medical significance
   - Could document edge cases
